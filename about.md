<p class="message">
  I'm a software engineer interested in building simple, self correcting systems that are reliable. I work at Dropbox, and am responsible for enabling product velocity and ensuring reliability of our megamonolith Python web application.
  
  I've also [written](https://dropbox.tech/application/speeding-up-a-git-monorepo-at-dropbox-with--200-lines-of-code) for the Dropbox [tech blog](https://dropbox.tech/tech/2019/05/athena-our-automated-build-health-management-system).
