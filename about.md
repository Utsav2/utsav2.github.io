I'm a software engineer interested in building simple, self correcting systems that are reliable. I work at Dropbox, and am responsible for enabling product velocity and ensuring reliability of our monolith Python web application, and larger async systems like [Cape](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/cape-technical-deep-dive).

I've also [written](https://dropbox.tech/application/speeding-up-a-git-monorepo-at-dropbox-with--200-lines-of-code) for the Dropbox [tech blog](https://dropbox.tech/tech/2019/05/athena-our-automated-build-health-management-system).
