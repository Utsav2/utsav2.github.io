I'm a software engineer interested in building simple, self correcting and reliable systems. I'm interested in developer productivity, build systems, technical management and more. I work at [Vanta](http://vanta.com/).

I used to work at Dropbox, and was responsible for enabling product velocity and ensuring reliability of our monolith Python web application, and larger async systems like [Cape](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/cape-technical-deep-dive).

I've also [written](https://dropbox.tech/application/speeding-up-a-git-monorepo-at-dropbox-with--200-lines-of-code) for the Dropbox [tech blog](https://dropbox.tech/tech/2019/05/athena-our-automated-build-health-management-system) and host a [technical newsletter and podcast](https://www.softwareatscale.dev/)
